How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?

    • The Powerballgame in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results.
    • The Powerball game includes two parts. 
        o Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively-(1,2,3, 4, 5,... , 17,18,19, 20).
        o Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers(1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).
    • When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.
    . Every time you run your program/page, your would display the winning numbers,and your lucky numbers, and the result respectively.
